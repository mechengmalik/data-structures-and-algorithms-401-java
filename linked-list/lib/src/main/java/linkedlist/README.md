# Linked List

write the data structure Linked List with function:
* insert :to add node
* include : to find if the wanted value in on the linked List
* toString : to print the value of the linked list

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.in this data structure element points to the next.

## Approach & Efficiency
* Step through the code and keep track of the linked list's values in a table.
* Count from the tail of the linkedlist until you reach the element number (k.
* Verify the large O of the written code.
* Make sure the code matches the algorithm.
* Explanatory testing based on inputs and outputs.
* The linked list.
