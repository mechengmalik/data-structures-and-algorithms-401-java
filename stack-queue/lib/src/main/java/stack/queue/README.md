# Stacks and Queues
the program able to implement stack and queue using linked list

## Challenge #10
## Create a Stack class that has a top property. 

The class should contain the following methods:
* push:adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.
* pop:Returns the value from node from the top of the stack ,Removes the node from the top of the stack
* peek : Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
* is empty :Returns: Boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

## Create a Queue class that has a front property.

The class should contain the following methods:
* enqueue:adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue
* dequeue:Returns the value from node from the front of the queue Removes the node from the front of the queue
* peek :Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
* is empty :Returns Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty





## Approach & Efficiency

* push  and enqueue method:

  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* pop  and dequeue method :
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* peek method:
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
* is empty
  * Time O(1)
  * Space O(1)
  
## API
* Create a top attribute for the Stack class.
* The following methods should be included in the class:
* push:pushes that value to the top of the stack as a new node.
* pop:Returns the value of the top-of-the-stack node,
* peek: removes the node from the stack's top: Returns: The node at the top of the stack's value is empty: Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the stack is empty or not.
* Create a front property in the Queue class.
* The following methods should be included in the class:
* enqueue: adds the item to the rear of the queue as a new node.
* dequeue:Returns the value from the queue's first node. Removes the node from the queue's front.
